-Data Ingestion:

  Real-time Data Ingestion: Use tools like Apache Kafka or Amazon Kinesis to ingest real-time ad impressions, clicks/conversions, and bid requests data streams.
  Batch Data Ingestion: Implement batch ingestion pipelines using tools like Apache Spark or Apache Airflow to process historical data from files or databases.
-Data Processing:

  Standardization and Enrichment: Develop data transformation pipelines using Apache Spark or Python libraries like Pandas to standardize and enrich the data across different formats.
  Data Validation and Deduplication: Implement validation checks to ensure data integrity and deduplication mechanisms to remove duplicate records.
  Correlation Logic: Use data matching algorithms to correlate ad impressions with clicks and conversions based on common identifiers like user IDs or ad campaign IDs.
-Data Storage and Query Performance:

  Data Storage Solution: Choose a storage solution like Apache Hadoop (HDFS), Amazon S3, or Google Cloud Storage to store processed data efficiently.
  Data Warehousing: Utilize data warehousing solutions like Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, or Snowflake for fast querying and analytical processing of ad campaign data.
  Data Partitioning and Indexing: Optimize data storage by partitioning data based on relevant attributes (e.g., timestamp, campaign ID) and creating appropriate indexes for faster query performance.
-Error Handling and Monitoring:

  Data Anomaly Detection: Implement anomaly detection algorithms or use monitoring tools like Prometheus or Datadog to detect data anomalies, discrepancies, or delays.
  Alerting Mechanisms: Set up alerting mechanisms using tools like PagerDuty or Slack to notify stakeholders about data quality issues in real-time.
  Logging and Auditing: Maintain detailed logs of data processing pipelines and establish auditing mechanisms to track changes and ensure compliance with data quality standards.
By incorporating these components into our data engineering solution, we can address the challenges faced by AdvertiseX in managing and analyzing vast amounts of data generated by digital advertising campaigns.
